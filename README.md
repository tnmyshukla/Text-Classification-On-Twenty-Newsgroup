# Text-Classification-On-Twenty-Newsgroup
For dataset I used the famous "20 Newsgroups" dataset.

The data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. I've imported the datset in the notebook itself as it is available in scikitlearn library.

The code is pretty straight forward and well documented. The preprocessing of the documents and the implementation of classifiers have been done from scratch and then the results have been compared to inbuilt sklearn's classifiers. The code has been arranged in form of IPython Notebooks.
